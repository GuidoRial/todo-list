# A To-Do List made with React

## General Info

I considered using vanilla JavaScript to do this project, but in the end I decided that it was a good idea to test my knowledge of React with this project.

## What I used

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript
4. React

## Features

1. Create a todo. Users can create a TODO providing it with a title, description and priority
2. Edit a todo
3. Mark a todo as completed
4. Delete a Todo
5. Changes are saved in Local Storage

## Challenges

Editing a todo was the hardest part of this project, as I didn't know how to edit individual parts (a user might just change a todo's priority without modifying everything else). It took me a while to figure out, but in the end I solved it by taking the input fields value and making checking if they were empty or not. If it was empty then the todo retains it's original value, if it wasn't then it was re-written.

## What I learned

1. JavaScript
    - I learned how to use localStorage
2. React
    - Gained further understanding of React Hooks (useState and useEffect)
